                Balaji engineered abundance for generations of Srivara to come. The religious have rewritten his story to claim ownership of Balaji and his achievements as actually achievements of god, claiming the water god had reincarnated as Balaji and he was sent here to inspire further devotion to the water god.
he was one of the last with engineering knowledge and despite trying to get the kids interested in engineering and physics, everyone had plent to eat and plenty of ways to stay busy so everyone remaining lost interest in the skills which slowly dried up from the lands, along with the fresh water. None of us know what earth technologies he used to bring such a machine to life as we have never seen the desalination process before. we may not even have the types of materials on this world that the plant needs to restore the water.
