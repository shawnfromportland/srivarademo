                "Srivara means 'fertile lands." says Tamal.
"But these were made into fertile lands. Engineered. By the early explorers. Long ago, they found the rich coastal valley with fertile soil and consistent sunshine, however there was very little flat ground for construction of a settlement so they had to terrace the whole valley for settlements and crops." 
"The missing ingredient was fresh water, which they had to bring in to grow their crops in the discovered valley. The best builder among the explorers worked with the other men to construct a plant on the sea to bring freshwater to the crops. It ran strong for 150 years but it has broken down in recent years, just as the drought cycle is coming. The ways of engineering have been lost in these lands. Over the generations and it has been forgotten. They pray to their gods for rain."
He thoughtfully takes another bite of stew.
