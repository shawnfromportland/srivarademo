                Srivara means fertile lands. they were made fertile lands. engineered. by the early explorers. long ago, the explorers found this rich coastal valley with fertile soil and consistent sunshine, however there was very little flat ground for construction of a settlement so they had to terrace the whole valley for settlements and crops. the valley lies in a region that is subject to periods of sustained drought, and growing subsistence crops becomes really hard due to no access to water. the most clever builder among the explorers worked with the other men to construct a plant on the sea to bring freshwater to the crops. it ran great for 150 years but the ways of engineering have been lost in these lands, people dont value that knowledge anymore over the generations and it has been forgotten. the best answer they can come up is prayer to their gods for rain.
