                "The explorers were from earth. It took them years, generations to arrive here. it wasn't the original plan to build a settlement here. It was only supposed to be a detour to repair the aging craft they traveled in, but the ships unexpectedly broke down. When they had discovered a fertile valley just inland from the coast a few miles from their ships sheltered from the harsh winds and storms, they thought it was almost perfect to settle in except for lack of fresh water for growing crops. 
The explorers found the narrowest path from the sea to the fertile valley, and built a way for the seawater to irrigate the terraces of crops at Srivara. its been more than 170 years since the last of the explorers passed away. The explorers were made up of many earth factions, but it was the tiny religious minority among them who ended up with the most influence among the descendents of these lands. Over the generations, their religion has evolved from what it was on earth, and adapted into a new metaphysics custom-made for Srivara and Srivarans.
