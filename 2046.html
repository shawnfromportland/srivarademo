                The explorers were from earth. it took them years, generations to arrive here. it wasn't the plan to colonize, it was only supposed to be a detour here to repair the aging craft they traveled in. but the ships unexpectedly broke. after sending out exploratory parties in the region, they had discovered a fertile valley just inland from the coast, shletered from the harsh winds and storms, with fertile grounds, but it was subject to harsh sustained droughts cyclically. The explorers found the narrowest path from the sea to the fertile valley, and built a way for the seawater to irrigate the terraces of crops at srivara. its been more than 170 years since the last of the explorers passed away. The explorers were made up of many earth factions, but it was the religious minority among them who ended up with the most influence among the descendents of these lands. over the generations the religion has evolved from what it was on earth, adapted into a new metaphysics for srivara and for srivarans.
