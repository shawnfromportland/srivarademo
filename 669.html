"Just two of the dozens of original explorers held onto their earthly religions. They kept their religion to themselves at first, but through progressively more generations by the time the last of the explorers died out Srivara's leadership was under control of a descendent of the original religious settlers. Their earth religion had evolved into something new for srivara, for srivarans." 

"It's popularity began to rise and it's mythology grew for another hundred years until almost every Srivaran followed the temple, and they had no need to be concerned with engineering or science anymore. When the water was flowing, their crops grew, and all was harmonious. Now, during the drought cycles that we have learned come every few decades regularly here, they turn to their god with ever more elaborate ways of worship to beg for the pipe to flow once again with freshwater to sustain their crop."
