                just a tiny minority, two or three of the original explorers, held onto their earthly religions. they kept it to themselves at first, but through progressive generations, by the time the last of the explorers died out, Srivara's leadership was under control of a descendent of the religious clan among the original settlers. but their earth religion was evolving, into something new for srivara, for srivarans. it's popularity began to rise and it's mythology grew for another hundred years. at this point they have no need to be concerned with engineering or science anymore. when the water was flowing, their crops grew, and all was harmonious. now duriung the dought cycle, they turn to their god with ever more elaborate ways of worship to beg for the pipe to flow once again with freshwater to sustain their crop.
